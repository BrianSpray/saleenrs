This is Saleen, a high-performance rs server based off Hyperion.
Core networking is Netty and has multiple new functions to monitor the server and users.

It is still being DEVELOPED, so it is NOT advised to use this server in any way.
Bugs DO exist and will eventually be fixed.

If you notice anything that should not be there or should be changed, please let me know.
